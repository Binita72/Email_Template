  Dear abc, 
 Your effort on behalf of the Boys and Girls Club to engage our staff in a worthwhile charitable event is noteworthy. Your participation in the organization of the silent auction, the buffet appetizers, the cocktail hour, and locating speakers provided our company with significant positive press in the local community. 
 When my wife and I attended the event, several people thanked me for providing company resources to assist with the event. Your time and commitment stand out, but you also recruited 15 other staff members. Everywhere we went at the event, our staff was helping due to your recruiting and commitment to the charitable cause. 
 Our employees were parking cars, delivering and recording silent auction wins, greeting guests, running the coat check, and more. The company logo on their sweaters was a nice touch, too, as all attendees saw the level of support that we provided at the event due to your charitable contributions. 
 It feels good to know that your efforts set a fund raising record for the club. I wanted to take the time to tell you that we deeply appreciate your charitable contributions of time, energy, and talent to such a worthy cause on our behalf.

 Due to ABC Inc recent acquisition of XYZ Company, our executive management has decided that some restructuring of our department is in order so that our transition through this merger can be as seamless as possible. 
 This is, in general, very good news for all of us, for we will be onboarding ten new sales representatives â€“ which will both relieve our current understaffing situation and prepare us for the heightened sales operations this merger is anticipated to trigger. 
 I am scheduling a staff meeting for tomorrow from 12 pm to 1 pm where I will outline the steps of this important transition; lunch will be provided. Please feel free to reach out to me at any time during the next few weeks with any questions or concerns. 
 Best regards,

 Dear XYZ, 
 I wanted to drop you a line personally to let you know that I will be leaving LMK at the end of the month. I am sorry to go, but as you know, I will be starting school in August and I want to give my studies my undivided attention. 
 I have learned so much during my time here, and you have been a big part of that. I want to thank you for your mentorship and guidance when I was an intern and your support during my search for the right graduate program. 
 Please keep in touch. My email address is email@email.com and my phone number is 555-555-5555. Let get coffee sometime during the coming semester and you can tell me all the news about the best team in the business.

 Dear Ms. XYZ, 
 I am extremely sorry for my late arrival at the important sales meeting with The Star Agency last week. My tardiness almost lost us a valuable client. 
 I understand that, as a sales team, we need to always present ourselves as professional and reliable, and timeliness is a large part of that professionalism. I, therefore, let down the entire sales team with my behavior. 
 I am currently taking steps to ensure that I am never late again for a client meeting (or any other work-related event). I was delayed due to my car breaking down, so I am getting my car serviced. From now on, I will also be sure to leave for meetings even earlier than I already do, so even in the case of an emergency, I will still be able to arrive on time. 
 Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to reassure you and the rest of the company that I greatly value my position on the sales team, and that I will not let the team down again. Thank you so much for your understanding. 
 Sincerely, 
 ABC",2
"Dear XYZ, 
 Please accept this apology letter for the mistake I made handling the Brenton project. I apologize profusely for what happened, and you have my word it will never occur again. 
 I misread my calendar and thought I had until the [date] of [month] to complete the project. Therefore, I thought I could delay the Brenton account and focus on other pressing matters. I do not offer this story as an excuse, but merely to tell you where I went wrong. It was a silly mistake on my end, and I will ensure I do better with all our clients. 
 I accept full responsibility for this situation. If you feel the need to suspend my employment temporarily or take away my commission on the account, then please feel free to do so. I am also in the process of writing a detailed apology letter to the people at Brenton Industries to inform them of the situation. I understand at this point it is uncertain if they will continue doing business with us, and I will do everything in my power to keep them on as clients. 
 I hope you can forgive me, and I hope to prove through my work that I only want the absolute best for all our clients. 
 Sincerely,

"[Date] 
 Dear [Company name] employee: 
 As we are all aware, the economy is posing challenges for everyone. We need to be financially responsible and proactive. To that end, I have asked the executive team to review all business goals, objectives and processes in order to find ways to decrease expenses, increase revenue and protect the future well-being of [Company name]. 
 As a result of this analysis and in an effort to manage company assets conservatively during this economically challenging time, the executive team has come to a difficult but necessary conclusion. Effective [date], all exempt employees will receive a 5 percent reduction in their annual salary and all nonexempt employees will receive a 5 percent reduction in their hourly pay rate. In addition, all overtime work will cease and employees are expected to continue to work their regular full- or part-time schedule. 
 This was an extremely tough decision, and we understand the impact this will have on you and your family. However, please know that we considered several other alternatives, and the choice we made is the best option at this time and will have the least impact on our employees overall. 
 The executive team will continue to monitor [Company name] finances and reevaluate this decision each quarter this year. We believe the outcome from this measure will better position the company for a solid financial future. 
 We appreciate all of your hard work, and we know we will have your support as we all strive for continued business success. Should you have any questions, please don not hesitate to speak with your manager or contact human resources.

"Dear xyz,
Having been accepted to name for the year fall term to pursue a Bachelor in Architecture, I am writing to express my desire to participate in the University Leadership Scholarship Program. For as long as I can remember, I have had a strong passion for architecture, my favorite Texas landmark being the pink granite edifice of the State Capitol. I am particularly excited by the opportunity to join a network of leaders who help to maintain UT Austin reputation as a world-leading public research university.
 My parents came to Texas as immigrants and have worked tirelessly in low paid jobs to provide for our family. If I am accepted to the program, I would be the first member of my family to benefit from a college education. My goal is to use my education to give back to the community. I want to specialize in designing affordable and environmentally sustainable housing. My passion for this field was inspired by my winning virtual city design for the National Future City competition, and I am all too aware of the impact of high housing costs and environmental destruction on underprivileged communities. 
 Servant leadership is the philosophy I intend to follow as a program participant and alumni. I want society to benefit from my education and UT Austin to gain prestige as an institution providing innovation for the greater good. This scholarship would enable me to achieve these aims. In fact, my high school principal is an alumnus of the program. She has been a huge inspiration to me and many others, and I hope to follow her example should I be accepted.
 Please get in touch to arrange a meeting with me. I would love to tell you more about my upbringing and my desire to give back to my community through my further education.
